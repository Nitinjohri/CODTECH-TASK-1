OVERVIEW OF MY PROJECT

I AM MAKING A HOUSE PRICING PREDICTION THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING(LINEAR REGRESSION) WITH THE SUPPORT OF PYTHON
I HAVE PASTED MY OUTPUT DOWN IN THE ARTICLE
THERE SOME INITIAL STEPS SHOULD FOLLOW TO CODE.....
1) Problem Definition: Define the problem you are trying to solve and the goals of the project. This involves understanding the business context and what constitutes success.
2) Data Collection: Gather the relevant data that you will use to train and evaluate your machine learning model. This could involve collecting data from databases, APIs, or other sources.
3) Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, dealing with outliers, normalizing data, and transforming variables as needed. This step is crucial as it 
   ensures the quality of data going into the model.
4) Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing data that might help improve the performance of the model. This could include transformations, aggregations, or 
   other methods to extract useful information.
5) Data Splitting: Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, 
   and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance.
6) Model Selection: Choose the appropriate model or models to use based on the problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.) and the characteristics of the data.
7) Model Training: Train the selected model on the training data. This involves fitting the model to the training data and learning the underlying patterns.
8) Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters, which are parameters that are not learned during training but affect the learning process.
9) Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model on the validation set to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification) or RMSE, 
   MAE, R-squared (for regression) are commonly used.
10) Model Validation: Validate the model on the testing set to ensure that it generalizes well to unseen data. This step helps to confirm that the model has not overfitted to 
    the training data.
11) Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model into production where it can be used to make predictions on new data. This could involve creating APIs, integrating with 
    existing systems, or other deployment strategies.
12) Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance in production and retrain it as necessary with new data to ensure that it remains accurate over 
    time.
